        <h2>Full Privacy PVC Fencing for Maximum Seclusion</h2>
        <p>
            If you're looking to fully block out neighbours, wind, and street
            views, full privacy PVC fencing is the ideal solution. These solid
            panel fences offer complete coverage with a sleek, modern finish
            that never needs painting or upkeep. It's a popular choice for side
            and rear boundaries on Central Coast properties.
