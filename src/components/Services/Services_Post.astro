        <h2>Strong and Stylish Post and Rail PVC Fencing</h2>
        <p>
            Post and rail PVC fencing is a classic choice for larger properties,
            rural blocks, paddocks, or front boundaries. It offers open
            visibility with clean lines and strong structure, all made from
            UV-resistant PVC that won’t rot, splinter or require repainting.
            It’s a practical, long-term solution for anyone needing to define
            property lines or contain animals.
