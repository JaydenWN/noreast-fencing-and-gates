        <h2>Meet The Owner & Installer at Noreast Fencing and Gates</h2>
        <p>
            Gary is the hands-on operator behind Noreast Fencing and Gates.
            Having lived on the Central Coast for almost 20 years, Gary has
            accumulated extensive on-site experience and a strong eye for
            detail. Gary has built a reputation across the Central Coast for
            delivering professional PVC fencing installations that are done
            right the first time.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
            Unlike larger companies that send out random crews, Gary is the one
            quoting your job, installing your fence, and making sure every post
            and panel is perfectly aligned. Gary is supported by a handpicked
            team of installers to assist in completing every fence. Itâ€™s this
            level of care, consistency, and local know-how that sets Noreast
            apart.

                I would highly recommend Gary and Noreast Fencing and Gates.
                Gary provided a competitive quote for my new fence. He was a
                great communicator and let me know what was going on at all
                times, he arrived and worked on the fence when he said he would
                and was friendly, polite and honest. I couldn't be happier with
                the job he did.
